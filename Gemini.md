### Project Overview

This project is a 100% local, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that is an expert on the video game "X4 Foundations." It is designed to act as a conversational AI partner, providing both factual information and engaging, in-character dialogue.

### Core Architecture: The "Researcher/Actor" Model

The project implements a two-stage pipeline to ensure responses are both factually accurate and conversationally engaging:

1.  **The "Researcher" (Fact-Finding Stage):** When a user's query contains a specific in-game keyword, the system first retrieves relevant documents from a FAISS vector store. A "Researcher" LLM then synthesizes these documents into a single, dense paragraph of verified, relevant facts. If no facts can be found, it signals a failure with "NO_CLEAR_ANSWER".

2.  **The "Actor" (Performance Stage):** This is the final, user-facing LLM. It receives the user's original query and the clean, synthesized paragraph from the Researcher as its context. This allows the Actor to focus on creative, in-character performance, using the pre-vetted context as its ground truth.

### Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** FastAPI
*   **RAG Pipeline:** LangChain
*   **Vector Store:** FAISS
*   **Embedding Model:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
*   **LLM:** Local LLM served via LM Studio (e.g., `meta-llama-3-8b-instruct`)
*   **Keyword Extraction:** `thefuzz`

### Data Pipeline

The project uses a `Makefile` to manage a data pipeline that processes the X4 Community Wiki data. The pipeline consists of the following steps: unzipping the data, generating a corpus, chunking the corpus, building a vector store, and generating and refining keywords.

### Overall Goals

The main goal is to create a chatbot that is both a knowledgeable expert and an engaging conversationalist for the X4 Foundations game. The "Researcher/Actor" architecture is the key to achieving this by separating the fact-finding and performance stages.
