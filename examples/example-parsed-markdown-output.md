# How to dock your ship

## Manual Landing

After requesting docking permission (see below), approach the designated docking bay and use the on-screen guidance to help you land flat, in the center of the bay.

The land, the following 4 parameters must be met exactly:

1. The ship nose must point in the right direction
2. The ship must be parallel to the landing pad
3. The ship must be located centrally over the landing area
4. The ship must be hovering at a certain height

## Docking Computer-Assisted Landing

The Docking Computer helps the player to land by taking over when the playership has almost met the above 4 parameters.

 The **Mk1** version will kick into when the player has almost landed, saving the need to meet the parameters very precisely. The **Mk2** version kicks in while the playership is further from the landing point, streamlining landing further.

## Request Permission to Dock

1. Left click on station to select it.
2. Right Click to bring up context menu and select "Request dock at"

* Alternatively select the station and use Shift +D
* You must be within a 6km to dock, so if it is unavailable, you may be too far, the docking module is full or the player needs higher reputation with the owning faction.

## Navigate to docking area

Follow the green landing lights to the approximate docking area.

The green lights may not always indicate the optimal path, so be aware of obstacles in your path.

When approaching the landing pad, there will be a faint hologram of the flown ship superimposed over the allocated landing pad in the required alignment.

Slowly fly towards this location, being mindful of speed, position and alignment. It may be best to try and fly above the spot, then descend into it.   

## Find the docking alignment indicator

As the landing pad is approached, a red triple chevron symbol will point towards the docking alignment indicator. If facing the completely wrong direction, there will be a U-turn symbol in the top left of the screen.

Try to center it onto your screen.

## Use alignment indicator to land

Your initial alignment may be very bad.

First, center your heading reticle on the target in the alignment indicator and rotate so that you're level.

Now, strafe left/right so that the red triangle with a line above it is centered. When you're centered, you'll see two arrow tips light green.

Now, slowly move forward or backwards to bring the red triangle in alignment with the line. You should see more of the diagram light up green when perfectly aligned.

Now, just slowly strafe down until docked. You may need to make minor adjustments at the landing pad, but you'll soon be landed.

HINT: it may be easiest/quickest to lock steering using <Spacebar> once the (round, central) target indicator is green, then use strafe, Q/E to roll, & slowly accelerate/decelerate until ILS alignment is correct. Only then should you use S strafe to move down onto the pad - Snafu
