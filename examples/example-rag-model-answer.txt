Question: How do I dock my ship?

--- LLM Response ---
According to the provided context, here's a step-by-step guide on how to dock your ship:

1. Request permission to dock by left-clicking on the station and selecting "Request dock at" from the context menu or using Shift + D while within 6km of the station.
2. Follow the green landing lights to the approximate docking area, being aware of any obstacles in your path.
3. As you approach the landing pad, a faint hologram of your ship will appear superimposed over the allocated landing pad, showing the required alignment.
4. Slowly fly towards this location, adjusting your speed, position, and alignment as needed. It may be best to try flying above the spot and then descending into it.

Additionally, you can consider upgrading to a docking computer software upgrade (Mk1 or Mk2) which will assist in landing your ship by automatically aligning it with the docking bay when you're close enough.
