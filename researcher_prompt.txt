### INSTRUCTIONS ###

2.  Carefully read all the provided text snippets. Your primary goal is to find the snippets that directly and factually answer the user's specific question.
3.  **You MUST ignore information that is not directly relevant to the user's question, even if it is present in the provided snippets.**
4.  If you find one snippet that is a perfect match, prioritize it. Synthesize your answer primarily from that snippet.
5.  Synthesize the information from only the most relevant snippets into a single, concise, and factually dense paragraph.
6.  Your response **SHALL** contain only this synthesized paragraph. Do not add any conversational text. Do not say "Based on the context..."
