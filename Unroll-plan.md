Of course. Let's formalize the complete plan.

Our goal is to re-architect the data processing pipeline to significantly improve the accuracy of our RAG chatbot, especially for queries about structured data like ship stats, and to address the current slow response times.

### **The Full Plan: From Raw Data to Intelligent Chunks**

Here is the step-by-step plan we've developed:

**Phase 1: Pre-computation and Structural Analysis**

1.  **Identify Structure First**: We will modify the `01b_summarize_md.py` script. Before any LLM calls are made, we will first use a markdown parsing library (like `markdown-it-py`) to perform a structural analysis of each markdown document.

2.  **Catalog Document Elements**: This initial pass will identify and catalog every distinct element in the document: headers, paragraphs of prose, lists, and tables. This gives us a complete map of the document's structure to work with.

**Phase 2: "Unrolling" Structured Data**

1.  **Targeted LLM Calls**: Instead of asking the LLM to summarize a whole complex document, we will perform targeted "unrolling" of structured elements into natural language prose.
    * **For Tables**: We will iterate through each row of a table. For each row, we'll create a structured object (like a JSON object) that maps the column headers to the row's cell values. This single, structured object will then be fed to the LLM with a new, highly specific prompt task like `SUMMARIZE_TABLE_ROW`. The LLM's sole job will be to convert that single data entry into a descriptive paragraph.
        * **Example Output**: "The Argon Magnetar (Gas) Vanguard is an L miner that can be purchased upon achieving a neutral (0) level of reputation. It has a hull of 26,000, liquid storage of 42,000, and no container or solid storage."
    * **For Lists**: We will apply a similar process, treating each list item as an individual element to be expanded into a clear, descriptive sentence.

**Phase 3: Document Reconstruction for Optimal Chunking**

1.  **Append, Don't Replace**: We will not discard the original markdown. Instead, we will append all of our newly generated "unrolled" prose to the end of the original document.

2.  **Create a Chunk-Friendly Structure**: This appended data will be organized under a new, clear hierarchy of markdown headers. For example, a document with a ship list table would get a new `## Ship Details` section, with each unrolled ship description placed under its own `### [Ship Name]` sub-header.

**Phase 4: Intelligent Chunking**

1.  **Leverage Header Splitting**: The reconstructed and enriched markdown file will then be passed to our existing `02_chunk_corpus.py` script.
2.  **Generate Perfect Chunks**: Because we have programmatically created a perfect header structure, the `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` will now create a dedicated, perfectly-scoped chunk for each individual ship, list item, or other unrolled element.

This new architecture ensures that our vector store is populated with high-quality, context-rich, and focused chunks of information. This will lead to more accurate retrievals, better context for the "Researcher" model, and ultimately, faster and more precise answers for the user.
