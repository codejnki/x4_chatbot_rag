User: How do I build a station?

: To build a station in Friendly Space, start by opening the map and navigating to the Manage Plots tab. Choose your desired plot size and create a new plot. Obtain blueprints for the modules you need and plan the station by prioritizing module placement, ensuring turrets and shields are equipped first. Save your construction plan frequently.

Begin with placing a Dock Module to allow early management and docking capabilities. Use the upper left window to select and place other modules, adjusting their heights using vertical connection points as necessary. Ensure all modules are properly connected for functionality. Equip turrets and shields by clicking the plus symbol behind module names. Once satisfied with your design, save it and assign a Builder ship to construct the station. Hiring an NPC Builder costs 50k credits but may disengage if needed elsewhere; using an owned CV avoids this issue.

User: What are the different factions?

: The X-Universe includes distinct factions that can be categorized into allies and enemies. Notable allies are the Alliance of the Word, Holy Order of the Pontifex, Godrealm of the Paranid, Teladi Company, Argon Federation, Paranid, and Antigone Republic. Enemies include groups such as Duke's Buccaneers, Fallen Families, Kha'ak, Scale Plate Pact, Vigour Syndicate, Xenon, Terran Protectorate, and others.

User: What are the best weapons?

: The best weapons in the X-Universe game depend on the specific situation and desired outcome. The Bolt Repeater is effective for high burst damage with poor heat management, while the Ion Blaster is useful for removing shields without causing significant hull damage. The Plasma Cannon offers long range but has a slow projectile speed. The Pulse Laser provides a balanced approach with good damage, range, fire rate, accuracy, and heat management. The Shard Battery launches multiple high-damage projectiles that scatter at longer distances. Missile-based attacks can use the Dumbfire Launcher for basic missiles, the Torpedo Launcher for significant hull damage, or the Tracking Launcher for advanced missile types like EMP, Guided, Heatseeker, Smart, and Swarm. For mining asteroids, the Mining Drill is a weak beam weapon with bonus damage. The Fusion Beam Cannon is the most powerful weapon, capable of destroying nearly every ship with a single shot, boasting a 14 km range and dealing almost a million damage per shot, making it an ultimate siege weapon against both ships and stations.

Boarding requires sufficient Marine crew across your player-owned ships and involves three stages: Approach, Infiltration, and Assault. For abandoned ships, scan for a data leak with your spacesuit, fix it to gain control of the security systems, order the ship to open its dock, and then float into it to pilot it yourself. Always ensure you have a spare pilot available during these operations.

Navigating through Highways, Superhighways, Orbital Accelerators, Jump Gates, and Anomalies can facilitate swift movement across vast sectors. Understanding docking procedures, spacewalking, and being aware of navigational hazards like minefields and electromagnetic storms is crucial for a successful exploration.

User: How do I manage my fleet?

: To manage your fleet in X-Universe, you select ships to be followers and assign them as DEFEND under a new leader, indicated by a plus + symbol. Ships can still receive explicit player orders that overwrite their current behavior for tasks like trade runs or changing targets during battles. Use resupply ships such as Carriers or Fleet Auxiliary Ships to obtain necessary Blueprints and resources through manual ordering, automatic trading, or acquiring resources via trade offers. Activate automatic resupply and repair functions by setting Automatic Resupply in the Global Orders section of the Empire menu under Player Information to High, Medium, or Low. Fleets attached to auxiliary ships will automatically go for repairs if they have no orders in their queue. Ships can also fly in formations, with the leader's command order menu allowing selection of the desired formation.

User: How do I use the research and development system?

: To access the research and development system in X4 Foundations, players must first complete the Player Headquarters Plot. Once unlocked, you can start by selecting a technology from the Research menu at the Player Headquarters and clicking "Start Research." Only one item can be researched at a time, but goods can be stored for future projects. Ensure that all required resources are available at the research facility to ensure the upgrade completes within the specified timeframe. Automation is similar to production stations, with player or NPC ships delivering goods, adding money to the headquarters' budget, and allowing trade restrictions to be set via the Logical Station Overview (LSO). Note that nividium must be mined by player-owned ships since NPC factions do not mine it.

User: How do I get a player headquarters?

: To acquire a player headquarters, begin the game using any starter except for "Terran Cadet," "Project Genesis," "The Accomplished Scientist," or a custom gamestart with the headquarters already complete. Additionally, ensure that the Kingdom End DLC is not active. If you start with Kingdom End active and did not choose one of the aforementioned starters, dock at the headquarters in Heretic's End and converse with Boso Ta to claim ownership and unlock research.

Once these requirements are met, teleport your HQ to the designated sector, open the terraforming menu (identified by a planet icon with gears), and select a project. The construction and delivery will proceed automatically as long as resources remain available.

User: Explain the purpose of the Long Range Scan (LRS) and how its mechanic has changed in recent updates.

: The Long Range Scan (LRS) is a feature that enables players to detect objects in space, marking them on the map with "?" icons. Initially, it only pings detected objects. Over time, the mechanic evolved from Mk1 to Mk2, which provides increased scan resolution and color-coding for different types of small objects: blue rings indicate wrecks and uncommon lockboxes; yellow rings signify explosive asteroids and rare lock boxes; purple rings denote anomalies and data vaults; and grey/white rings represent other unidentified objects.
